# Getting started with Docker

<p align="justify">
<strong>

- Let's first understand the need for Docker. Let's say you are working on a project where we have different set of tech stack we are working on, let's suppose them as follows:
  - `Web Server` : `node.js` & `express.js`
  - `Database` : `MongoDB`
  - `Messanging` : `Redis`
  - `Orchestration` : `Ansible`
- It's difficult to build this application with all these differnet componetns.
- Mainly, there compatibility with the underlying OS is a big issue. We have to ensure that all these services are com[paitble with the OS version we are working on or planning to use.
- Than we have to check the compatibility of the versions of libraries an dependencies on the OS. Then we have to check compatibility pf services with the library. There may be cases when one service requires a specific version of dependent library, where ass another service requires another version.
